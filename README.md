# MNM Diagnostics - task solution
### Description
Create a classifier based on the provided small dataset. The target to predict is in the Class attribute and the positive class encoded as 1. Prepare a notebook demonstrating and justifying the steps you have taken to arrive at the final model. Furthermore, create an accompanying data visualization app (e.g., in Dash or Shiny) which will allow for the analysis of feature distributions and correlations between the features. If you are familiar with Docker, place the app in a Docker container.
